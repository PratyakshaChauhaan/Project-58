             My hobby is reading book interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in 5th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hoby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyel punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
